# Dell-Precision-7510-OSX
Tutorial for a working Mac OS Mojave (10.14.x) environment on the Dell Precision (7510). 

I can claim none (zero, zilch, nada) of what is in this repo as my own work. 

Sources are those usual hackintosh sites so credit goes to where credit is due.

Some of the machine specs are as follows:

- 4k Diaplay

- Xeon E3-1505M V5 (Onboard Intel HD Graphics P530)

- 64GB ECC RAM

- Samsung 950 Pro NVMe SSD

- Samsung 850 Pro 2TB SSD

- Nvidia Quadro M1000M w/2GB GDDR5 

- Dell DW1560 (BCM4352) - Replacing stock Intel Wireless 8260

- Bios Version is latest at the time (1.17.7)
